# MAGIC # Fizz Buzz Test
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The Fizz-Buzz test was invented by Imran Ghory to test candidates applying for various software development roles.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You can find out more about the history of this test by reading the article
# MAGIC <a href="http://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/" target="_blank">Using FizzBuzz to Find Developers who Grok Coding</a></br>
# MAGIC which dates back to January 24, 2007.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The test, and your challenge, reads as follows:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for  
# MAGIC > multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the  
# MAGIC > multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples  
# MAGIC > of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."  
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC A couple of hints:
# MAGIC * You will need a for-loop that iterates over the numbers 0 to 100 inclusive.
# MAGIC * Inside the loop, you will need a combination of **`if`**, **`elif`** and **`else`** statements.
# MAGIC * The modulo (**`%`**) operator will give you the cleanest method for testing for divisibility by 3 and 5.
# MAGIC * Start with a short list, say 1 to 15, during your initial development and then scale out to 100 when you think you are ready.
# MAGIC * Don't worry about how pretty your code is - there are many different ways of completing this challenge - all of them are correct, if the output is correct.
